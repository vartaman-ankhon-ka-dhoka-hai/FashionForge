## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation & Running

1. The application is already configured to run on Replit
2. Click the "Run" button to start the development server
3. The app will be available at the provided Replit URL

### Default Credentials

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@urbanthread.com`
- Password: `admin123`

Use the admin account to access the admin dashboard at `/admin` and manage products.

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` and configure as needed:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-in-production

# Add when ready to enable payments
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
# VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user (protected)

### Products
- `GET /api/products` - Get all products
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Get single product
- `POST /api/products` - Create product (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/products/:id` - Update product (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/products/:id` - Delete product (admin only)

### Orders
- `GET /api/orders` - Get user's orders (protected)
- `GET /api/orders/all` - Get all orders (admin only)
- `POST /api/orders` - Create order (protected)
- `PATCH /api/orders/:id` - Update order status (admin only)

### Payments (Placeholder)

## Design System

The application follows a premium dark theme with these key colors:
- **Primary (Orange):** `#f97316` (hsl 24 95% 53%)
- **Background:** Very dark gray (#121212)
- **Card:** Slightly lighter gray (#171717)
- **Foreground:** Near white for text

See `design_guidelines.md` for complete design specifications.

## Database Migration

The application currently uses in-memory storage. To migrate to MongoDB or PostgreSQL:

1. Install database driver:
   ```bash
   npm install mongoose  # For MongoDB
   # or
   npm install pg drizzle-orm  # For PostgreSQL
   ```

2. Implement database-backed storage in `server/storage.ts`:
   - Extend or replace `MemStorage` class
   - Implement all methods in `IStorage` interface
   - Update connection in `server/index.ts`

3. The schema is already defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle ORM

## Deployment

### Replit Deployment
1. This project is already configured for Replit
2. Use the "Deploy" button to publish
3. Set environment variables in Replit Secrets

### Alternative Platforms
- **Vercel:** Deploy frontend, use serverless functions for API
- **Render:** Deploy full-stack app with web service
- **Railway:** Deploy with auto-detected build configuration

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading for product images
- React Query caching for API responses
- Optimistic UI updates for cart operations
- Minimized bundle size with code splitting
- Persistent cart state across sessions

## Security Features

- Password hashing with bcryptjs (10 salt rounds)
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Protected API routes with authentication middleware
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- XSS protection via React's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection ready for production

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:
- User authentication flow
- Product browsing and filtering
- Cart management
- Checkout process
- Admin product CRUD operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Payment Integration:** Complete Stripe/Razorpay setup
